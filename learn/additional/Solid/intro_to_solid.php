// Solid principle:
/*
 * The SOLID principles are like guidelines for organizing the library in
 * such a way that everything is well-structured and easy to maintain,
 * making the system both flexible and scalable
 *
 *
 */

// What are SOLID principles? and wy
/*
 * - solid principles are 5 design guidelines intended to make software
 *   design more understandable, flexible, and maintainable
 * - These principles were introduces by robert C. Martin and are
 *   foundational in OOD (object-oriented design)
 * - They help in avoiding software design issues that can lead to rigid,
 *   fragile, and hard to maintain code.
 *
 * why => to improve:
 * - Maintainability
 * - Testability
 * - Readability
 * - Reusability
 *
 * Note:
 *  - it is not always helpful sometime, the code will be better if you
 *    don't use solid principles

// 5 Solid Principles:
/*
 * 1) SRP => Single Responsibility principle
 *      - A class should have one, and only on reason to change
 *
 * 2) OCP => Open/Closed principle
 *      - software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be
 *        open for extension, but closed for modification.
 *
 * 3) LSP => Liskov Substitution principle
 *
 * 4) ISP => Interface Segregation principle
 *
 * 5) DIP => Dependency Inversion

// To understands you need to learn:
/*
 * - You should be strong in OOP
 * - You should have a lot of practice on OOP
 * - You should not be a beginner developer,
 *   you need to have some projects.
 * - If you don't understand then this means you need to have some
 *   experience before.
