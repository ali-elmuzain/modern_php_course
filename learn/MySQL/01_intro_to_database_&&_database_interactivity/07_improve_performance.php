// improve DB performance with indexes
/*
 * the query might take amount of times depending on the query it self
 * and the amount of entry in the table to make it much more faster
 *  - you can add index to the name for example so it will be more faster
 *     => to do this go to structure then add column index then add one
 *  - to test it you can add to the query
 *     => ignore index (index)
 *  - note that this will not affect the group

// Improve group by performance
/*
 * to do that you need to add an index to multiple columns
 *   - create an index on 2 columns (go)
 *    - then add index to
