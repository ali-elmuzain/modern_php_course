// strings within single quotes & combine string within (.) operators
/*
 * strings is a sequence of character

 * concatenation:
 *      - you can add strings to other strings using .
 *
 * note:
 *  - use escaping to ignore '\' ' now you can add this single quote to
 *    your string
 *  - single quote is much more faster than double quotes because there
 *      is no parsing with it
 *  - when using double quotes => when you need to parsing like handling
 *      variables
 *
 *
 * special character:
 *      - \n => new line
 *      - \t => tap
