/*
arrays:
----------
    - learn about 02_arrays and associative array
    - with this we can create mapping between key and a value
    - In this chapter this will allow us to create mapping between
        - books and their corresponding author

Associative Arrays:
------------------
    - Learn about associative arrays
    - With this we can create mappings between a key and a value
    - this chapter will allow us to create a mapping between
        books and their corresponding author.
    - we will explore how associative arrays allow us to accept
      parameters from the URL and create forms.

/*
    - example an array contain the author as the key and its books as the value
        so when you need to access a book you can do this by its author name
